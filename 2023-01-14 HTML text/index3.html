        <h3>Introduction</h3> 
        <p>Ahmadi Mtizi is a 100-year-old maize farmer </p>   
          <p>from Tanzania, and thanks to donors like you, he can see again.</p> 
        <p>Maize farming is a tough job, regardless of age. Ahmadi, still strong at 100 years,</p>
         <p>took pride in caring for his family. However, when he began to </p>
        <p>lose his vision he also lost his ability to provide for his family .</p> 
        <hr>
          <p>Ahmadi soon learned of Seva’s local vision screening camp,</p> 
          <p>where he was diagnosed with a cataract. Thanks to a local Seva partner clinic,</p>
          <p>he happily returned the next day for sight-restoring surgery at no cost to him.</p>
          <p>After the surgery, when the doctors removed his eyepatch, Ahmadi was spellbound.</p>
          <p>“I am very happy. Very happy,” he said in English.</p>
          <p>Today he tends to his crops, provides for his family,</p>
          <p>and continues to live independently and with dignity thanks to your support.</p>
